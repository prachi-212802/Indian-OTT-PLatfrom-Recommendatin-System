## Indian-OTT-PLatfrom-Recommendatin-System
The recommendation system aims to provide users with a personal online product or service recommendation to address the growing problem of online information overload and to improve customer relationship management. Various recommendation system strategies have been proposed since the mid-1990s, and many types of recommender system software have recently been developed with various applications.

In this project I have reviewed the current scenario of Indian OTT platforms and proposed a recommendation algorithm for the same. From understanding the recommender systems from basics to
analysing the today’s well known recommender system “Netflix Recommender System”, have came up with an algorithm/ recommender system for Indian OTT Platforms. Proposed system recommends movies
which are most similar to the original movie content wise and pop- ularity wise, which have the maximum vote_count.

The example of Indian OTT Platform taken is of “JioCinema”
